Optic Neuritis Conversion to Multiple Sclerosis
**In this study, we utilized an online dataset from the Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial (ONTT), a randomized controlled trial that evaluated the effects of corticosteroids on acute optic neuritis and the subsequent development of clinically definite multiple sclerosis (CDMS). The publicly available ONTT dataset can be accessed online at http://lons.jaeb.org/.
